# TextHarbor: Summary AI 📚🤖

## Overview 🌐
TextHarbor is an AI-powered summarization tool designed to extract concise and informative summaries from text content. This repository includes code for both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques, allowing users to choose the method that best fits their needs.

## Extractive Summarization 🧹
### Preprocessing 🛠️
The code includes a robust data preprocessing pipeline for text, handling tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and the removal of irrelevant elements like hyperlinks, hashtags, and retweet indicators.

### Frequency-based Scoring 📊
The extractive summarization utilizes a frequency-based scoring system. Each word's frequency in the text is normalized by the maximum frequency, creating a score. Sentences are then scored based on the sum of their word scores, normalized by sentence length.

### Summary Generation 📑
The final summary is generated by selecting the top sentences with the highest scores. Users can control the summary length, with a default setting of 30% of the total number of sentences.

## Abstractive Summarization 🚀
### Transformer Model 🤯
TextHarbor employs the Pegasus transformer model for abstractive summarization. This state-of-the-art model is fine-tuned to generate coherent and contextually appropriate summaries.

### Usage 🚀
Users can easily generate abstractive summaries using the provided code. The summarization pipeline involves tokenization, model input generation, and decoding the model's output into a human-readable summary.

## Getting Started 🚀
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HareKrishna4747/TextHarbor.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the extractive summarization code for quick and informative summaries.
4. Explore abstractive summarization using the Pegasus model for more advanced summarization needs.

Feel free to experiment with different texts and adjust parameters to achieve the desired level of summarization.
